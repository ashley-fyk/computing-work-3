~~ hello ~~ 
Ms Lim,
I'm happy that you're my teacher;
I enjoy each lesson you teach.
As my role model you inspire me
To dream and to work and to reach.

With your kindness you get my attention;
Every day you are planting a seed
Of curiosity and motivation
To know and to grow and succeed.

You help me fulfill my potential;
I'm thankful for all that you've done.
I admire you each day, and I just want to say,
As a teacher, you're number one!

You have taught historical concepts well to us well.
You had taught us to infer from the source.
You are always patient in rectifying our mistakes.
Thank you!
